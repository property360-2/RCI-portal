**Goal:** Implement intelligent enrollment with prerequisite validation, INC blocking, and approval chain visibility.

**Deadline:** **October 27, 2025** 

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL NOTES:**
- **Enrollment UI must be inside the Admission module** (accessible after Admission officer logs in)
- **Use the Documents table to store user credentials/requirements** (not a separate table)
- **Always refer to the documentation** (concept-plan.md, schema.md, pages-to-implement.md, use-cases.md) for accuracy

---

### **4.1 Admission Module ‚Äì Smart Enrollment UI with Auto Account Creation**

**Owner:** Mary Ann (Frontend) + Kirt (Backend)

#### **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:**

- **The enrollment functionality is part of the Admission module UI**, not a separate module
- Admission officers will handle the enrollment process for students
- Use the **Documents table** to store uploaded requirements/credentials (see schema.md)
- Refer to **pages-to-implement.md Section 3.2** for the expected UI structure

#### **Tasks:**

* [ ] **Student Account Auto-Generation**
  - System automatically creates user account upon enrollment:
    - **Username format:** First letter of first name + Full surname (e.g., "jdelacruz" for Juan Dela Cruz)
    - **Password:** Auto-generated student number (e.g., "2025-0001")
  - Store in Users table with role="student"
  - Student receives credentials (displayed in confirmation screen, can be printed/emailed)
  - Backend API:
    - `POST /api/students/create-account/` ‚Üí auto-generates username and student number

* [ ] **Two-Step Enrollment Confirmation Process**
  
  **Step 1: Fill Enrollment Form**

    - Program selection (dropdown)
    - Year level (dropdown: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th)
    - Semester (dropdown: 1st, 2nd, Summer)
    <!-- - Upload requirements (Documents table: Birth Certificate, Form 137, ID Photo, etc.) wala pa to, maybe soon -->
    - refer to the document sent by sir in the ojt gc
  - Button: **"Continue"** ‚Üí proceeds to Step 2

  **Step 2: Confirmation & Final Submission**
  - Display summary of all entered data:
    - Student information review
    - Selected program and year level
    - List of enrolled subjects (auto-generated based on year/sem)
    - Uploaded documents list
  - **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning/Danger Alert Box:**
    ```
    ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Please verify all information carefully.
    
    Are you sure the data you're about to submit to the system is accurate?
    Once submitted, this will create a permanent student record.
    
    Auto-generated credentials/ student can edit it if they want custom username and password:
    Username: [jdelacruz]
    Password: [2025-0001] (Student Number)
    
    [‚úì] I confirm that all information is accurate and correct.
    ```
  - Checkbox: Must check before final submission
  - Buttons: **"Go Back"** (edit form) | **"Confirm & Submit"** (finalize enrollment)

* [ ] **Block Enrollment for 1st Year, 1st Semester**

* [ ] **Student Credentials/Requirements Storage**
  - Use **Documents table** to store uploaded requirements
  - Fields to populate:
    - `student_id` (FK to Students)
    - `doc_type` (e.g., "Birth Certificate", "Form 137", "ID Photo", "enrollment form")
    - `file_path` (local server storage path)
    - `uploaded_by` (admission officer's user_id)
  - UI: File upload component with document type dropdown

* [ ] **Enrollment Approval Chain Visibility (Student Side)**
  - Show enrollment status: ‚è≥ Pending / ‚úÖ Approved / ‚ùå Rejected
  - Student can view this in their own dashboard (Joshua's task)

#### **Backend API (Kirt):**
* [ ] `POST /api/students/create-account/` ‚Üí auto-generates username (first letter + surname) and student number
* [ ] `GET /api/enrollment/recommended/{student_id}/` ‚Üí returns eligible subjects
* [ ] `POST /api/enrollment/validate/` ‚Üí validates prerequisites + INC status
* [ ] `POST /api/enrollment/submit/` ‚Üí submits enrollment with two-step confirmation
